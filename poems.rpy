As you all know, the Sol system has been besieged by a stealth Rebel offensive.

This is an order to all Federation units to retreat from the Sol system.
All units must report to the Federation base at the Polaris sector in preparation for a counter-offensive.
Everyone who is in support for the prosperity of the Federation and mankind is welcome to join us.
The journey will be an arduous one, so it is imperative to equip your ship appropriately.
While we may have lost the battle today, we have not lost our dignity.
We will return and take back what we lost.

Godspeed, and good luck."""
