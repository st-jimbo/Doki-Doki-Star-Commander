![Logo](/mod_assets/logo2.png)

It's the far, far future. The Literature Club, in their very own starship, have found themselves in a bit of a predicament as a miscalculated jump landed them thousands of light years away from Earth. It's a long journey back home and it's up to you to bring them back in one piece!

## Features
- Turn-based ship-to-ship combat, charge up your weapons and blast enemy ships and pirates apart!
- Command your ship with each Doki assigned to a system on the ship. Communicate with your crew and optimize your ship's systems when the situation calls for it!
- Strengthen your ship with upgrades such as new shield generators, engines, weapons, or just acquire a new ship altogether. Don't slack, as the enemy will only get tougher!
- (WIP) Space is mysterious, so you never know what you'll encounter out there with random events alongside the main story. Don't be afraid to take risks, captain, as you may surely be rewarded.
- (WIP) A story where you are tasked with bringing the dokis back home in one piece.
